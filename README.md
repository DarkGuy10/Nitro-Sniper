<h1 align="center">NitroSniper</h1>
<p align="center">A Discord self-bot for sniping nitro gift codes, written in Python3.</p>

# Warning!
Self bots like this break Discord's TOS and hence your account may get **banned**. <br>
I do not endorse these in anyway, this code is just a test.

# Requirements:
Following python modules are required:
```
discord.py
requests
```

# Environment variable
The token for the self bot must be stored in an environment variable named `TOKEN`.<br>
Alternatively, you can edit `line #5` of `NitroSniper.py`

# Deploying
The repo is ready to be deployed on heroku.<br>
###### Make sure to edit the config vars properly!
